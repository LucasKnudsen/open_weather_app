### Using the browser's geolocation to make API calls
Plucking out users location through getCurrentPosition, I'm making two GET requests through Axios to Open Weather and Open Cage. 
This way I get access to a lot of info about the users whereabouts and weather details. 

This info is in turn displayed in the browser.
